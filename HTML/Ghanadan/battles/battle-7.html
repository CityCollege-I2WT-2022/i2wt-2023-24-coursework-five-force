            Prelude to the Battle
        </h2>
        <p class="pageContent">
            In the early months of 1945, the Third Reich was on the brink of collapse. The Soviet Red Army had pushed the German forces back through Eastern Europe and stood poised to assault the German capital. Adolf Hitler, refusing to concede defeat, ordered that Berlin be defended to the last man. Meanwhile, the Soviet Union, led by Joseph Stalin, aimed to capture Berlin both for its symbolic significance and to maximize their influence in post-war Europe.

            The Siege and Assault on Berlin
        </h2>
        <p class="pageContent">
            The battle began with the Soviets encircling Berlin in mid-April 1945. Massive artillery barrages and air attacks preceded the ground assault. The German defense, though determined, was largely composed of poorly trained conscripts, Volkssturm (national militia), and remaining regular army units. The Soviets, under Marshals Georgy Zhukov and Ivan Konev, launched a two-pronged assault on the city, engaging in intense urban warfare. The fighting was fierce and destructive, with both sides suffering heavy casualties.

            The Soviet forces advanced street by street, facing desperate resistance from the Germans. The civilian population of Berlin suffered immensely during the siege, with widespread destruction, shortages of food and water, and the threat of violence omnipresent.

            The Fall of Berlin and Hitler's Death
        </h2>
        <p class="pageContent">
            As Soviet troops closed in on the city center, Adolf Hitler, along with several of his top officials, took refuge in the FÃ¼hrerbunker. On April 30, with the Soviets just blocks away, Hitler committed suicide. Following his death, German resistance began to crumble. On May 2, General Helmuth Weidling, the commander of the Berlin Defense Area, unconditionally surrendered the city to the Soviet forces.

            The capture of Berlin was a significant blow to Nazi Germany and marked the end of the European conflict in World War II. Within days of Berlin's fall, Germany offered unconditional surrender, which was formally accepted on May 8, 1945, marking the end of the war in Europe, a date celebrated as Victory in Europe Day (V-E Day). The battle had immense implications, not only militarily but also in terms of human suffering and the political landscape of post-war Europe.
