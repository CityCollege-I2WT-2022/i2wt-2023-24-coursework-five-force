            Prelude to the Battle
        </h2>
        <p class="pageContent">
            Following their defeat at Stalingrad, the German Wehrmacht sought a decisive victory on the Eastern Front to regain the initiative. The Kursk salient, a bulge into German lines in the Soviet Union, was selected as the site for a massive offensive, codenamed Operation Citadel. The Soviet leadership, aware of the German plans through intelligence sources, prepared extensively, fortifying the region with multiple layers of defensive positions and amassing a large concentration of troops and armor.

        <p class="pageContent">
            The battle began on July 5, 1943, with the German forces launching their assault on the northern and southern flanks of the Kursk salient. The Soviets had prepared an extensive network of defensive fortifications, including minefields, anti-tank guns, and artillery, which significantly slowed the German advance. The fighting was characterized by large-scale tank battles, notably at Prokhorovka, where the Soviets deployed their T-34 tanks against the German Tiger and Panther tanks in one of the largest tank engagements ever.

            The intensity of the combat was unprecedented, with both sides suffering heavy losses. The German forces made some initial gains but were unable to break through the Soviet defenses. The sheer number of Soviet reserves, both in manpower and armor, played a crucial role in blunting the German offensive.

        <p class="pageContent">
            By mid-July, the German offensive had lost its momentum, and the Soviets launched a series of counteroffensives. These attacks, which stretched along the entire Kursk salient, gradually pushed the German forces back. The Soviet strategy involved a combination of frontal assaults, pincer movements, and encirclements, exploiting the weakened state of the German armies.

            The battle continued throughout July and into August, with the Soviets regaining territory and inflicting substantial losses on the German forces. The success of the Soviet counteroffensive was a testament to their improved military tactics, enhanced coordination, and the effective use of combined arms, including infantry, armor, and air power.
