            Attack on Pearl Harbor (1941)
        </h1>
        <p class="pageContent">
            The attack on Pearl Harbor, a surprise military strike by the Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service, occurred on the morning of December 7, 1941. This event holds a significant place in World War II history, as it led directly to the United States' entry into the war. The attack targeted the U.S. Pacific Fleet stationed at the Pearl Harbor naval base in Hawaii and was aimed at preventing U.S. interference in Japan's military operations in Southeast Asia.

            Prelude to the Attack
        </h2>
        <p class="pageContent">
            Tensions had been escalating between the United States and Japan due to Japan's aggressive expansionist policies in Asia and the Pacific. The U.S. had imposed economic sanctions on Japan, including oil embargoes, in response to Japanese aggression in China and Southeast Asia. These sanctions severely impacted Japan's ability to continue its military campaigns, leading the Japanese leadership to plan a preemptive strike against the U.S. Pacific Fleet.

            The Day of the Attack
        </h2>
        <p class="pageContent">
            On December 7, 1941, in a meticulously planned assault, Japanese aircraft launched from carriers struck Pearl Harbor in two waves. The attack caught U.S. forces by surprise and inflicted severe damage. Key targets included battleships, airfields, and aircraft. The USS Arizona and USS Oklahoma were among the battleships that suffered catastrophic hits. In total, the attack sank four battleships, damaged four others, and destroyed or damaged numerous aircraft and smaller vessels.

            Aftermath and Immediate Consequences
        </h2>
        <p class="pageContent">
            The attack on Pearl Harbor resulted in significant American casualties, with over 2,400 service members and civilians killed and more than 1,000 wounded. The following day, December 8, 1941, President Franklin D. Roosevelt addressed Congress, calling the day of the attack "a date which will live in infamy." The speech led to the United States declaring war on Japan, officially entering World War II. Subsequently, Germany and Italy declared war on the United States.

            Strategic Impact and Legacy
        </h2>
        <p class="pageContent">
            While the attack achieved its intended surprise and inflicted substantial damage, it failed to cripple the U.S. Pacific Fleet permanently. Crucially, the U.S. aircraft carriers, key assets in the coming Pacific War, were not present at Pearl Harbor during the attack. The event galvanized American public opinion, transforming isolationist sentiment into a unified resolve for war. The attack on Pearl Harbor marked a pivotal moment in world history, reshaping the course of World War II and the geopolitical landscape of the 20th century.
