        While the attack on Pearl Harbor served as a catalyst, diplomatic efforts and alliance building had been underway long before the United States officially entered the war. The Lend-Lease program, initiated in 1941, facilitated the provision of significant military and economic assistance to the Allies, particularly the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union. This assistance was crucial in sustaining the Allied war effort and bolstering the resistance against Axis aggression.
        The Atlantic Charter, a joint declaration issued by President Roosevelt and British Prime Minister Winston Churchill in 1941, outlined the principles that would guide the post-war world. It affirmed the commitment to collective security, self-determination, and the establishment of a world order based on democratic values. While the United States was not officially at war at this point, the Atlantic Charter laid the groundwork for the formation of the United Nations and the collaborative efforts that would shape the post-war era.
