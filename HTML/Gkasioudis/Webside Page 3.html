        The gradual shift from isolationism to interventionism in the United States was a nuanced process influenced by several factors. One key element was the growing awareness of the atrocities committed by totalitarian regimes, particularly Nazi Germany. The reports of Hitler's persecution of Jews, aggressive territorial expansion, and violation of international norms began to alter public perception. Images and stories of the Spanish Civil War, where Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy supported General Francisco Franco, further underscored the threat posed by authoritarian ideologies.
        Simultaneously, the United States faced economic challenges that necessitated a reconsideration of its isolationist stance. The Great Depression had taken a toll on the nation's economy, and policymakers recognized the potential benefits of international trade and alliances. Initiatives like the Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act of 1934, which empowered the President to negotiate trade agreements with other nations, reflected a growing acknowledgment that economic interconnectedness could be a powerful tool for stability and growth.
