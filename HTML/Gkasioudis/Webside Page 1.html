        In the aftermath of World War I, the United States, scarred by the human and economic toll of the conflict, adopted a policy of isolationism. The desire to avoid being entangled in foreign conflicts and focus on domestic issues was fueled by the traumatic memories of the Great War and the pursuit of a more restrained approach to international affairs. The isolationist sentiment was enshrined in legislative acts such as the Neutrality Acts of the 1930s, which aimed to prevent the United States from being drawn into external conflicts.
        Despite the rising tensions in Europe and Asia during the 1930s, fueled by the aggressive expansion of Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan, the prevailing sentiment among Americans was to remain aloof from the conflicts brewing overseas. The memory of the "war to end all wars" and the economic hardships of the Great Depression created a wariness toward involvement in distant conflicts, as the nation focused on its own recovery.
