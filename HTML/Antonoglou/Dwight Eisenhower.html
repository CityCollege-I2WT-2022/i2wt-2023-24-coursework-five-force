    <p>During World War II, <strong>Dwight Eisenhower</strong> was Supreme Commander of the Allied Expeditionary Force in Europe and achieved the five-star rank as General of the Army. He planned and supervised two of the most consequential military campaigns of World War II: Operation Torch in the North Africa campaign in 1942â€“1943 and the invasion of Normandy in 1944. Eisenhower oversaw the invasions of North Africa and Sicily before supervising the invasions of France and Germany.<br>
